    The Labraheeler <br/>
    has gained the best traits of both parents. This is a sweet, affectionate, and loyal dog that is
    very family-centric. They are active, curious, and even make great guard dogs. This breed also has very high
    intelligence and has been engaged in many different careers such as police work, agility training, hunting, guarding,
    search and rescue, and tracking. This is outside of the normal herding, retrieving, and fishnet pulling activities.
